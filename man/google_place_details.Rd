\description{
Once you have a place_id from a Place Search, you can request more details

Details request. A Place Details request returns more comprehensive information
about the indicated place such as its complete address, phone number, user
rating and reviews.

\section{API use and limits}{


The amount of queries you can make to Google's APIs is dependent on both the service
and the API you are using.

Each API has specific quotas and limits. Check Google's API documentation for details.

View your usage at the Google Cloud Console \url{https://console.cloud.google.com/}

Each API can only accept and return one request at a time. If you write a loop
to make multiple API calls you should ensure you don't go over your quota / limits
during the loop.
