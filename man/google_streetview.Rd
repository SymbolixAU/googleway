google_streetview(
  location = NULL,
  panorama_id = NULL,
  size = c(400, 400),
  heading = NULL,
  fov = 90,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{numeric vector of lat/lon coordinates, or an address string.}

\item{panorama_id}{a specific panorama ID.}

\item{size}{numeric vector of length 2, specifying the output size of the
image in pixels, given in \code{width x height}. For example, \code{c(600, 400)}
returns an image 600 pixles wide and 400 pixles high.}

\item{heading}{indicates the compass heading of the camera. Accepted values are
from 0 to 360 (both 0 and 360 indicate north), 90 indicates east, 180 south and 270 west.
If no heading is specified a value will be calculated that directs the camera
to wards the specified \code{location}, from the point at which the closest
photograph was taken.}

\item{fov}{determines the horizontal field of view of the image. The field of
view is expressed in degrees, with a maximum allowed value of 120. When dealing
with a fixed-size viewport, as with Street View image of a set size, field of
view in essence represents zoom, with small numbers indicating a higher level of zoom}

\item{pitch}{specifies the up or down angle of the camera relative to the
Street View vehicle. This is often, but not always, flat horizontal.
Positive values angle the camera up (with 90 degrees indicating straight up);
negative values angle the camera down (with -90 indicating straight down)}

\item{output}{specifies whether the result should be displayed in R's viewer,
or embedded as HTML inside a webpage.}

\item{response_check}{logical indicating if the function should first check if
the image is available. If TRUE and no image is available, a warning message
is printed and no image will be downloaded. if FALSE and no image is available,
a blank image will be displayed saying 'Sorry, we have no imagery here'.}

\item{signature}{a digitial signature used to verify that any site generating
requests using your API key is authorised to do so. See Google Documentation
for further details \url{https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro}}

\item{key}{string. A valid Google Developers Street View Image API key}
}
