\arguments{
\item{search_string}{\code{string} A search term representing a place for
which to search. If blank, the \code{location} argument must be used.}

\item{location}{\code{numeric} vector of latitude/longitude coordinates
(in that order) around which to retrieve place information.}

\item{radius}{\code{numeric} Defines the distance (in meters) within which to
return place results. Required if only a \code{location} search is specified.
The maximum allowed radius is 50,000 meters. Radius must not be included if
\code{rankby} is used. see Details.}

\item{rankby}{\code{string} Specifies the order in which results are listed.
Possible values are \code{"prominence"} or \code{"distance"}.
If \code{rankby = distance}, then one of \code{keyword}, \code{name} or
\code{place_type} must be specified. If a \code{search_string} is used then
\code{rankby} is ignored.}

\item{keyword}{\code{string} A term to be matched against all content that
Google has indexed for this place, including but not limited to name, type,
and address, as well as customer reviews and other third-party content.}

\item{language}{\code{string} The language code, indicating in which language
the results should be returned, if possible. Searches are also biased to the
selected language; results in the selected language may be given a higher ranking.
See the list of supported languages and their codes
\url{https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport}.}

\item{name}{\code{string} \code{vector} One or more terms to be matched against
the names of places. Ignored when used with a \code{search_string}. Results will
be restricted to those containing the passed \code{name} values. Note that a
place may have additional names associated with it, beyond its listed name.
The API will try to match the passed name value against all of these names.
As a result, places may be returned in the results whose listed names do not
match the search term, but whose associated names do.}

\item{place_type}{\code{string} Restricts the results to places matching the
specified type. Only one type may be specified. For a list of valid types,
please visit \url{https://developers.google.com/places/supported_types}.}

\item{price_range}{\code{numeric} \code{vector} Specifying the minimum and
maximum price ranges. Values range between 0 (most affordable) and 4 (most expensive).}

\item{open_now}{\code{logical} Returns only those places that are open for
business at the time the query is sent. Places that do not specify opening
hours in the Google Places database will not be returned if you include this
parameter in your query.}

\item{page_token}{\code{string} Returns the next 20 results from a previously
run search. Setting a \code{page_token} parameter will execute a search with
the same parameters used in a previous search. All parameters other than
\code{page_token} will be ignored. The \code{page_token} can be found in the
result set of a previously run query.}

\item{simplify}{\code{logical} - TRUE indicates the returned JSON will be coerced into a list. FALSE indicates the returend JSON will be returned as a string
into a list.}

\item{curl_proxy}{a curl proxy object}

\item{key}{\code{string} A valid Google Developers Places API key.}

\item{radar}{deprecated, no longer used}
}
\description{
The Google Places API Web Service allows you to query for place information
on a variety of categories, such as: establishments, prominent points of interest,
geographic locations, and more.
}
\details{
A Nearby Search (using \code{google_places}) lets you search for places within a specified area.
You can refine your search request by supplying keywords or specifying the type of place you are searching for.


With the Places service you can perform three kinds of searches:
\itemize{
  \item{Nearby Search}
  \item{Text Search}
  \item{Place Details request}
}

A Nearby search lets you search for places within a specified area or by keyword.
A Nearby search must always include a \code{location}, which can be specified
as a point defined by a pair of lat/lon coordinates, or a circle defined by a
point and a \code{radius}.

A Text search returns information about a set of places based on the \code{search_string}.
The service responds with a list of places matching the string and any location
bias that has been set.

A Place Detail search (using \link{google_place_details}) can be performed when
you have a given \code{place_id}
from one of the other three search methods.


\code{radius} - Required when only using a \code{location} search, \code{radius}
defines the distance (in meters) within which to return place results. The maximum
allowed radius is 50,000 meters. Note that radius must not be included if
\code{rankby = distance} is specified.

\code{radius} - Optional when using a \code{search_string}. Defines the distance
(in meters) within which to bias place results. The maximum allowed radius is
50,000 meters. Results inside of this region will be ranked higher than results
outside of the search circle; however, prominent results from outside of the
search radius may be included.
}
\note{
The Google Places API Web Service enforces a default limit of 1,000 free requests
per 24 hour period, calculated as the sum of client-side and server-side requets.
See \url{https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/usage} for details.

Use of the Places Library must be in accordance with the polices described
for the Google Places API Web Service \url{https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/policies}
}
\section{API use and limits}{


The amount of queries you can make to Google's APIs is dependent on both the service
and the API you are using.

Each API has specific quotas and limits. Check Google's API documentation for details.

View your usage at the Google Cloud Console \url{https://console.cloud.google.com/}

Each API can only accept and return one request at a time. If you write a loop
to make multiple API calls you should ensure you don't go over your quota / limits
during the loop.

\examples{
\dontrun{

## query restaurants in Melbourne (will return 20 results)
api_key <- 'your_api_key'

res <- google_places(search_string = "Restaurants in Melbourne, Australia",
                     key = api_key)

## use the 'next_page_token' from the previous search to get the next 20 results
res_next <- google_places(search_string = "Restaurants in Melbourne, Australia",
                          page_token = res$next_page_token,
                          key = api_key)

## search for a specific place type
google_places(location = c(-37.817839,144.9673254),
              place_type = "bicycle_store",
              radius = 20000,
              key = api_key)

## search for places that are open at the time of query
 google_places(search_string = "Bicycle shop, Melbourne, Australia",
               open_now = TRUE,
               key = api_key)
