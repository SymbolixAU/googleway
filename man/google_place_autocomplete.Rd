\item{location}{\code{numeric} vector of latitude/longitude coordinates (in that order)
the point around which you wish to retrieve place information}

\item{place_type}{\code{string} Restricts the results to places matching the

to which you would like to restrict your results. Currently, you can use
components to filter by country only. The country must be passed as a two

For example: components=country:fr would restrict your results to places within France.}

\item{simplify}{\code{logical} - TRUE indicates the returned JSON will be

\item{curl_proxy}{a curl proxy object}

\item{key}{\code{string} A valid Google Developers Places API key}
